# Manabu
Manabu is simple app that can help you in learning japanese.

Manabu is **not** meant to be only tool used for learning. It's only meant as tool to help you memorize japanese characters and vocabulary, and should be used alongside other tools or textbooks.

I'll focus on how app looks after implementing all base functionalities I have planned.

If you want to help in developement of Manabu, you can submit your feedback in GitHub issues, you can DM me on Discord (_skaner), or send your idea to manabu-ideas@skaner.site

# Instalation

## Windows
You can download Manabu from Releases tab and just run .exe, or compile source code for yourself using `cargo build --release` inside project root.

## Linux
Download and compile source code for yourself using `cargo build --release` inside project root. Might release pre-build binaries at some point in the future.
