# Manabu
Manabu is simple app that can help you in learning japanese.

Manabu is **not** meant to be only tool used for learning. It's only meant as tool to help you memorize japanese characters and vocabulary, and should be used alongside other tools or textbooks.

You can download Manabu from Releases tab, or compile source code for yourself using `cargo build --release` inside project root.
