# Kana practice rework
- split into learning and practicing
  - learning gives user kana and it's reading
  - practice uses only characters user seen in learning (or manually added to practice)
- split practice in 3 levels based on how many times user succeded in recognizing character
  - Level 1 - 0-2 - app displays character, and user have to select correct reading
  - Level 2 - 3-5 - app displays character, and user have to type reading
  - Level 3 - 6-X - app displays word using characters user has on level 3
- if user correctly recognises character first try during practice session, it's counter gets incremented
- practice session can be attempted every 2 hours, and consists of characters at levels 1 and 2, selected based on past user results
- when will characters appear:
  - 0-1 repeat - after 2 hours
  - 2 repeat - after 4 hours
  - 3 repeat - after 6 hours
  - 4 repeat - after 12 hours
  - 5 repeat - after 24 hours
- if character wasn't recognised when it was first shown to user during practice session, it'll be shown during next practice, and it's repeat counter won't be increased
- if user doesn't recognise character 3 times during one session, it's repeat counter gets decreased
- apart from normal practice session user can use "unlimited practice", where they can practice characters at level 2 and 3 any time for however long they want, but it won't change character repeat counter or level
